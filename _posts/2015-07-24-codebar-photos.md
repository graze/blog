Last week we hosted a [codebar](http://codebar.io/) event at graze HQ. 

> codebar is a non-profit initiative that facilitates the growth of a diverse tech community by running regular programming workshops.

codebar brings together people who want to learn how to code (students) and developers who love coding (coaches), so we thought it would be great to sponsor and host a codebar event.

After some tasty pizza and beers, Sam from our Web Team gave a [lightning talk](http://tech.graze.com/2015/07/17/naming-things/). Then each student paired up with a coach and everyone got down to some coding...

It was a great night and we had really positive feedback from the students and coaches who came along. codebar host events all over the country, so if you're keen to learn how to code, or would like to help teach others, [get involved](http://codebar.io/events)!
