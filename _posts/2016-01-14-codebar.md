On January 12th we hosted our second [codebar](http://codebar.io) event. For those that don't know...

> codebar is a non-profit initiative that facilitates the growth of a diverse tech community by running regular programming workshops.

People can register as students or coaches and learn something new with the help of volunteer coaches.

We enjoyed the last one we hosted a lot so we were looking forward to hosting our second and it did not disappoint! One of our front-end developers Lee started the evening by giving a [lightning talk on accessibility in web development](http://www.lendmeyourear.net/presentations/accessibility/accessibility-slides-codebar.html), which was very well received.

Then it was time to pair up students with coaches and get coding!

We had really positive feedback from the students and coaches who came along. codebar host events all over the country, so if youâ€™re keen to learn how to code, or would like to help teach others, [get involved](http://codebar.io/events)!
