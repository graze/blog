The graze tech team is growing at a remarkable rate. Our recent launch in the USA, along with our new kids and breakfast boxes mean we have a lot more demand on our time. So we're looking for hot tech talent!

graze are investing in the future. We're looking for exceptional technology graduates with a passion for all things tech. We run a code academy and invest in your personal development and training. And as a small company, you get involved in everything. Take a look at our [jobs page](http://graze.com/uk/jobs/tech). Oh, and with free breakfast and Friday beers, you can't go wrong.

##We look in universities...##

Our "lo-fi" cardboard box stand is often dangerously close to collapse, but we love it. It's been to Oxford, Cambridge and Bristol universities this year.

graze is a technology company and that's the message we want to share. Every part of our service is underpinned with world class technology to make it efficient and scalable. To do this we need world class tech talent so we're looking for the most talented, enthusiastic and entrepreneurial people to add to our already exceptional tech team. We met some very smart graduates who we'd love have in our team.

##... and we look at Silicon Milkroundabout##

We took a big team to [Silicon Milkroundabout](http://siliconmilkroundabout.com) so we could try to talk to everybody!

Launched in a London pub in 2011, Silicon Milkroundabout now has 2,000 people attending events and around 800 jobs on offer from 130 companies including Badoo, Shazam, Moo, Mind Candy and GoCardless. We met some very smart people and hope to get some of them into our web, fulfilment and production software platform, and data insight teams.

##Hello Simon##

Fresh into the team is Simon, our new web developer. He's only been here a few weeks but he's already all over the web codebase and our new allocation system which decides which products go in your box based on your snack preferences. He's using his maths skills to solve our most complicated of issues. But not when he's eating graze snacks in the phone box.

Our tech team has never been in such good shape. If you want to join the fun and work on incredibly challenging and interesting projects with some lovely people please check out our [jobs page](http://graze.com/uk/jobs/tech).
