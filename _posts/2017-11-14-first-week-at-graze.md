Hello, my names is Rokas and I am the newest member of the graze web team.

Originally from Lithuania, I recently moved to London to find new opportunities and quickly found graze to be my second home.

I'm driven by learning new technologies, and having the opportunity to work on technology like Docker and AWS, are just some of the many reasons I decided to join graze.

## Application and Interviewing process

The first stage of my interview was an informal chat with James, an engineering manager at graze. He introduced me to the company, its culture and helped me to understand the role. After that, I was given a short coding challenge to complete, using a technology stack of my choice.

After submitting the challenge, I was invited to the beautiful office in Richmond for a final round, face to face interview. I can surely say I was left with a huge impression by the team and the interview itself. The interview was split into three parts. Firstly, I had the possibility to show my logical thinking with the Operations team, Secondly, we discussed my technical skills and the decisions I made while completing the coding task with the web team. Finally, I had a half an hour long chat with the CTO himself to get a better understanding of graze and its ambitions.

## First week

My first week was focussed on getting me familiar with the teach team, familiarising myself with the web application code, and setting up my development environment. Fun fact, as a new starter I got a brand new MacBook Pro and bunch of gifts on my first day.

I was also given opportunities to meet different teams across the company, including a trip to the huge and interesting factory in Hayes.

Every single person in the office is very warm and quickly made me feel comfortable and I feel like I knew everyone after just a couple of days.

After completing a series of new starter challenges to help familiarise myself with the codebase, I got straight into working with with real life tasks, and have just submitted my first PR.
