We were delighted to be able to sponsor last night's [PHP London meetup](http://www.meetup.com/phplondon/events/224100230/). There were free drinks and snacks-a-plenty, plus an excellent talk from Sam Burns on 'Choosing and Using a REST Framework'.

> REST APIs are increasingly important as the development community moves towards SOA and externalising services, and choosing a framework can seem like a big decision.  Sam Burns explores the REST frameworks available in PHP, and gives tips on decoupling from the framework to facilitate future migrations.

If you're into PHP and are in the London area then we thoroughly recommend that you head along to the [next meetup](http://www.meetup.com/phplondon/)!
