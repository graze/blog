Here in the graze tech team we use [hipchat](https://www.hipchat.com/) to share interesting articles and engage in hilarious banter. We are big fans of using animated gifs in response to stupid questions and to settle arguments. Here are a selection of our favorites.

## Alan partridge eye roll

Alan Partidge is popular around here. We even have a service named after him (with the most awkward forced acronym possible)

example usage:

* Mathieu Pinet: what's a functional test?
* Lee Jordan: it's a test that works properly
* Mathieu Pinet: alan-eye-roll.gif

* Mathieu Pinet: not literally
* Mathieu Pinet: I'm moving chair and personal belongings and computer
* Mathieu Pinet: everything but desks if you think about it

## Jakeface

Ok so it's not an animated gif but I just wanted to share graze's very own in-house meme: the Jakeface&trade;

The real joke here is that he's not even called Jake.
