# A recruiterâ€™s tips

With Silicon Milkroundabout (SMR) approaching, Hannah Manku, an experienced recruiter here at graze, describes what it is that recruiters remember at networking events and why â€¦

>â€œNetworking gets you to meet real people, rather than speaking
through a screen or looking at a piece of paper...â€

Razel really sticks in our memory from last yearâ€™s SMR. Why? Because she did everything right â€“ before, during and after the event. Here are my Top 5 Tips on how to get yourself a job at SMR 2014.

##Pre-event

**Identify your favourite 5-10 employers attending the event.** Great to target the top companies. [As Razel said](http://tech.graze.com/2014/11/13/how-to-network-your-way-to-work/), itâ€™s imperative to do your research as it is a fantastic opportunity to sell yourself to a company that you are really keen on. We are always looking for people with the relevant skill set and attitude, so make sure you showcase both in abundance. And if you sound like youâ€™ve researched us, and can relate your experience, skills and values to ours, well then weâ€™ll be sure to like you.

**Come with a CV**, or at least your contact details, to pass to the team. We will want to contact you ASAP after the event, so make sure your CV is up to date and check out our roles before you come to the event so all the information on your CV is relevant and correct. 

##At the event

**Ask relevant questions**, which should come from your research. Donâ€™t be afraid to ask about the culture of the company. As much as this is an opportunity for us to find out about you, itâ€™s really important for you to make sure that our ambitions and values align with yours too.

**Be patient.** Sometime there will be queues, so please persevere . At previous SMR events, we have been REALLY busy, so please show some resilience and come back to see us when the team are free as we really want to speak to you, especially if youâ€™ve done your research!

##Post event

**Stay connected.** Feel free to connect with members of our recruitment team on LinkedIn, and please keep in touch with us. It might take a few days to get back to you, but we will, especially if, like Razel, you make yourself memorable by sharing stories about how your experience, skills, ambitions and values fit with ours. Razelâ€™s CV stood out visually too â€“ so it got her noticed â€“ but what made her memorable was the relevance and resonance she showcased both at SMR and in her leave behind CV. Curious, pioneering, friendly, commercial and resilient, Razel was a perfect fit.
