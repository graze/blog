As the company's appetite for data analysis and insight increases at an astonishing rate we have been looking for really talented data scientists and analysts to join the team. As a result we have 2 new faces here who need an introduction.

## Zoe

Zoe joined us having completed a year's placement at the UK Department for International Development after graduating in Physiological Sciences from Oxford University in 2012. When applying for our data analyst role she showed an insatiable appetite for using big data to solve real life business problems and a great interest in the company. Since joining the company in June, Zoe has already developed into a highly capable and intuitive analyst with people across the business fighting over her time and she is currently playing a significant role in our upcoming full launch into the USA - just check out the almost incomprehensible graph on Zoe's screen. We have a track record of taking graduates and investing time and effort in their personal development and Zoe is the perfect example of why we believe this is a great way of finding top talent. Zoe will be blogging about her experiences here so watch this space.

## Mike

Mike joined us in August from the Data Analytics team at Deloitte. He is a Physics graduate from Cambridge with an extensive background in data analysis and software development. He brings immense knowledge of information theory and machine learning at a critical time - his current focus is modelling and optimising our data integration with the USPS postal system, to help find an optimum routing arrangement, ahead of our upcoming full launch into the USA. Having said that we are not quite sure why he is so pleased with himself in his picture... not sure that wall is telling us much Mike? The fun will continue with his next mega-project which will be looking into how we should allocate products to our Graze boxes to create the best customer experience which will drive the highest customer lifetime value. He also has an excellent forehand.

Our data team has never been in such good shape and we are very lucky to have both Zoe and Mike both on board. If you want to join them and work on incredibly challenging and needle moving projects please check out our [jobs page](http://graze.com/uk/jobs/tech).
