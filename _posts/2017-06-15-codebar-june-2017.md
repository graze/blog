On June 13th we were proud to host our third [codebar](https://codebar.io) event at graze. codebar is a non-profit initiative with a very important purpose:

> Our goal is to enable underrepresented people to learn programming in a safe and collaborative environment and expand their career opportunities. To achieve this we run free regular workshops, regular one-off events and try to create opportunities for our students making technology and coding more accessible.

The evening started with pizza and a lightning talk on the subject:

> What would you tell yourself if you could go back in time to when you first started to code? **Version Control!**

After a brief overview of version control, some pre-version control horror stories were shared, as well as some tips for getting started.

(codebar offer a tutorial on version control on [their website](http://tutorials.codebar.io/version-control/introduction/tutorial.html) and there's a great interactive tutorial at [try.github.io](https://try.github.io))

Following the talk we split off into groups of coaches and students and got coding!

We received really positive feedback from the students and coaches who came along. codebar host events all over the country, so if you're interested in learning to code or are experienced and wish to coach others you can sign up on the [codebar website](https://codebar.io).
