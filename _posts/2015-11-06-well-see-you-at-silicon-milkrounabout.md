We're looking forward to [Silicon Milkroundabout](http://www.siliconmilkroundabout.com) next weekend. We'll be there on Sunday 15th November at the Old Truman Brewery in Shoreditch, London.

We're hiring for **PHP developers**, **front end developers** and **data analysts** to work on our custom built logistics and manufacturing systems, our data warehouse, our customer service and billing platforms, and our web and mobile user experience.

Come for a chat, and eat some snacks.
